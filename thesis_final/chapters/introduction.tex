\section{Background and Motivation}

Urban traffic congestion has emerged as one of the most pressing challenges facing rapidly developing cities worldwide, particularly in densely populated metropolitan areas of developing nations. Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh and home to over 22 million people, exemplifies this challenge with its notoriously congested roadways where average vehicle speeds can plummet to as low as 4.8 kilometers per hour during peak hours \cite{mustafa2023dhaka}. This severe congestion not only affects the daily lives of millions of commuters but also poses significant economic, environmental, and social challenges to the city's development.

The traffic situation in Dhaka is characterized by a complex mix of vehicular types, including buses, cars, motorcycles, rickshaws, auto-rickshaws, and various commercial vehicles, all competing for limited road space. The city's infrastructure, originally designed for a much smaller population, has struggled to accommodate the exponential growth in vehicle ownership and usage. According to recent studies, the economic cost of traffic congestion in Dhaka is estimated at approximately \$3.8 billion annually, representing a significant portion of the country's GDP \cite{karim2022traffic}.

The impact of traffic congestion extends beyond mere inconvenience. Emergency services, including ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles, face substantial delays when responding to critical situations. Research indicates that up to 56\% of emergency vehicle responses are delayed due to traffic congestion, potentially resulting in life-threatening consequences \cite{wu2014emergency}. This situation demands immediate attention and innovative solutions that can prioritize emergency vehicles while maintaining overall traffic flow efficiency.

Traditional traffic management systems in Dhaka rely heavily on manual control by traffic police officers or fixed-time signal systems that cannot adapt to real-time traffic conditions. These conventional approaches fail to address the dynamic nature of urban traffic, particularly in a city where traffic patterns are highly unpredictable and vary significantly throughout the day. The lack of intelligent traffic management systems has led to increased travel times, fuel consumption, air pollution, and overall deterioration in quality of life for residents.

The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, coupled with advances in machine learning and computer vision, presents unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize traffic management systems. Modern deep learning algorithms, particularly object detection models like You Only Look Once (YOLO), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-time detection and classification of vehicles and pedestrians. These technologies can be integrated with existing traffic infrastructure to create intelligent, adaptive traffic management systems that respond to real-time conditions.

\section{Problem Statement}

The primary problems addressed in this thesis are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Traffic Flow Management}: Current traffic management systems in Dhaka are predominantly manual or based on fixed timing schedules that do not account for real-time traffic density variations. This leads to unnecessary delays and suboptimal traffic flow.
    
    \item \textbf{Emergency Vehicle Delays}: Emergency services face significant delays due to traffic congestion, with no automated system to prioritize their passage through intersections. This results in delayed emergency response times that can have life-threatening consequences.
    
    \item \textbf{Lane Starvation}: Traditional traffic control systems often result in certain lanes receiving inadequate signal time, leading to traffic buildup and increased congestion in specific directions.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Adaptive Traffic Control}: Existing systems cannot adapt to sudden changes in traffic conditions, such as accidents, road closures, or special events, resulting in cascading congestion effects.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Integration of Modern Technologies}: Current traffic management infrastructure in Dhaka lacks integration with modern IoT, machine learning, and computer vision technologies that could significantly improve traffic efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Objectives}
