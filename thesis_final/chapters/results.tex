\chapter{Results and Analysis}
\label{ch:results}

This chapter presents the comprehensive results of our machine learning and IoT-based traffic management system. The evaluation encompasses dataset analysis, model performance metrics, system effectiveness, and real-world implementation results collected from strategic locations across Dhaka city.

\section{Dataset Overview and Preparation}
\label{sec:dataset_overview}

Our research utilized a comprehensive dataset collected from seven strategic traffic locations across Dhaka city, including Shahbag, Polton, Motijheel, Science Lab, Panthapath, Bijoy Sarani, and Gulistan. The dataset compilation process involved extensive data collection and meticulous annotation to ensure high-quality training data for our machine learning model.

\subsection{Dataset Composition}
The final dataset comprises \textbf{3,784 high-resolution images} captured during various traffic conditions and time periods. These images were systematically annotated to identify and classify objects into three primary categories: Regular Vehicles, Emergency Vehicles, and Pedestrians. The annotation process resulted in a total of \textbf{171,436 annotated objects} distributed across the dataset.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Dataset Distribution by Object Categories}
\label{tab:dataset_distribution}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}

\hline
Regular Vehicles & 107,004 & 62.5\% & 28.3 \\
Pedestrians & 63,541 & 37.1\% & 16.8 \\
Emergency Vehicles & 781 & 0.5\% & 0.2 \\
\hline
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{171,436} & \textbf{100\%} & \textbf{45.3} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The dataset distribution reveals the realistic traffic composition in Dhaka city, with regular vehicles constituting the majority of traffic participants, followed by pedestrians, and a small but critical proportion of emergency vehicles. This distribution accurately reflects the actual traffic patterns encountered in urban environments.

\subsection{Data Collection Strategy}
Data collection was conducted over a period of six months to capture seasonal variations and different traffic conditions. The collection strategy included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time-based Sampling}: Images were captured during peak hours (8:00-10:00 AM and 5:00-7:00 PM), off-peak hours, and nighttime to ensure temporal diversity.
    \item \textbf{Weather Conditions}: Data collection included various weather conditions including sunny, cloudy, rainy, and foggy conditions to improve model robustness.
    \item \textbf{Location Diversity}: Seven strategic locations were selected to represent different traffic patterns and road configurations across Dhaka city.
    \item \textbf{Quality Assurance}: All images underwent quality checks to ensure proper resolution, lighting, and minimal occlusion.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Performance Evaluation}
